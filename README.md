# Estimation of Tumor Growth Rate

## Description
In this project, we want to figure out the growth rate of tumors, including the rate of originating from a single cell, the rate off systemic tumors occurrence etc. To estimate the tumor growth rate, we need to known the time p between detection of the initial tumor and detection of the first recurrent tumor. Since time p is unknown to us at this stage, simulation is a good way to generate time p.
